# Displaying a String

To display a string, we can use the internal macro `PRINTF32`. Alternatively, we can use a function such as `puts`. In the file `print_string.asm`, displaying a string using the `PRINTF32` macro is implemented.

Following the example of the `hello_world.asm` file, implement string display using `puts` as well.


If you're having difficulties solving this exercise, take a peek at [hello_world.asm](../../../guides/hello_world/).
