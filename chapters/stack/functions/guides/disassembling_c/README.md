# Disassembling a C program

As mentioned, ultimately everything ends up in assembly language (to be 100% accurate, everything ends up as machine code, which has a fairly good correspondence with assembly code). Often, we find ourselves with access only to the object code of some programs and we want to inspect how it looks.

To observe this, let's compile a C program to its object code and then disassemble it. We'll use the `test.c` program from the lab archive.

> **NOTE:** To compile a C/C++ source file in the command-line, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal. (shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+T`)
2. Navigate to the directory containing your source code.
3. Use the command

> ```Bash
> gcc -m32 -o <exec> <sourcefile>
> ```
>
where `<sourcefile>` is the name of the source file (test.c) and `<exec>` is the name of the result executable.

If you **only** want to compile (**without** linking it), use:

> ```Bash
> gcc -m32 -c -o <objfile> <sourcefile>
> ```
>
where `<sourcefile>` is the name of the source file and `<objfile>` is the name of the desired output object file.

Since we want to transform `test.c` into an object file, we'll run:

```Bash
gcc -m32 -c -o test.o test.c
```

After running the above command, we should see a file named `test.o`.

Furthermore, we can use `gcc` to transform the `C` code in `Assembly` code:

```Bash
gcc -m32 -masm=intel -S -o test.asm test.c
```

After running the above command we'll have a file called `test.asm`, which we can inspect using any text editor/reader, such as cat:

```Bash
cat test.asm
```

In order to disassembly the code of an object file we'll use `objdump` as follows:

```Bash
objdump -M intel -d <path-to-obj-file>
```

where `<path-to-obj-file>` is the path to the object file `test.o`.

Afterwards, you'll see an output similar to the following:

```Bash
> objdump -M intel -d test.o

test.o:     file format elf32-i386

There are many other utilities that allow disassembly of object modules, most of them with a graphical interface and offering debugging support. `objdump` is a simple utility that can be quickly used from the command line.

It's interesting to observe, both in the `test.asm` file and in its disassembly, the way a function call is made, which we'll discuss further.
