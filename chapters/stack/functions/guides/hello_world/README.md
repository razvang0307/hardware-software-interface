# Hello, world!

Open the `hello_world.asm` file, assemble it, and run it. Notice the display of the message *Hello, world!*

Note that:

- The `hello_world.asm` program uses the `puts` function call (an external function of the current module) to perform the display. For this, it puts the argument on the stack and calls the function.
- The `msg` variable in the `hello-world.asm` program contains the byte `10`. This symbolizes the *line-feed* character (`\n`), used to add a new line on Linux.

Ending with `\n` is generally useful for displaying strings. The `puts` function automatically adds a new line after the displayed string, but this must be explicitly added when using the `printf` function.
